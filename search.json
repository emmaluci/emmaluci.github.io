    "section": "",
    "text": "Denver Broncos fans are already looking forward to the 2023 season. Dedicated fans were caught blindly optimistic after the five-year contract binding Russell Wilson to the 2021 team last march was able to fill the team’s quarterback position. Yet, after signing Wilson under a  hefty $245 million, it seems there aren’t any easy solutions for the franchise following his rocky start.  \nThe recent addition of head coach Sean Payton is certain to stir up a new found hope once again in the city of Denver and for fans across the country. Though the off season is the perfect time to project the future for the franchise, it is also the most important time to reflect on the past dreadful seasons. Not only did the team struggle tremendously last season, but they had reportedly the worst-scoring offense, averaging at just 16.9 points for each game they played. The injury of back left tackle Garret Boles left a huge dent in their offensive line. Denver was also one of the worst sack rate teams in the NFL this last season ranking in at 30th overall among teams. Many fans pointed fingers at Russell Wilson, as he was ranked 25th statistically out of 32 quarterbacks with at least 300 drop backs and a completion percentage that was surprisingly above the anticipated -1.1 percent. The broncos have been unsuccessful with filling the quarterback position comfortably since the loss of Peyton Manning after the team’s Superbowl winning 2015 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\n\nscoring22 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring22.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2022, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring21 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring21.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2021, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring20 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring20.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2020, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring19 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring19.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2019, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring18 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring18.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2018, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring17 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring17.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2017, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring16 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring16.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2016, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring15 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring15.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2015, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring14 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring14.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2014, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring13 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring13.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2013, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\nscoring12 <- read_csv(\"teamscoring12.csv\") %>% mutate(Tm = case_when(Tm == \"Oakland Raiders\" ~ \"Las Vegas Raiders\", Tm == \"Washington Redskins\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", Tm == \"Washington Football Team\" ~ \"Washington Commanders\", TRUE ~ Tm)) %>% mutate(Season = 2012, TeamSeason = paste(Tm, Season))\n\n\nscoring <- bind_rows(scoring22, scoring21, scoring20, scoring19, scoring18, scoring17, scoring16, scoring15, scoring14, scoring13, scoring12) %>%\n  filter(Tm != \"Avg Team\")\n\n#worst 50 scoring teams over last decade in bar chart\nworst40 <- scoring %>% top_n(40, wt= -PF) %>% \n  mutate(\n    fill_color = case_when(\n      Tm == \"Denver Broncos\" ~ \"1\",\n      TRUE ~ \"2\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=worst40, aes(x=reorder(TeamSeason, PF), weight=PF, fill=fill_color))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#FB4F14\", \"light grey\")) +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Of the 40 worst scoring teams in the league since 2012, where is Denver?

But as dedicated fans would love to have their questions answered, it interesting to look at exact numbers to prove some of these interesting rumors and questions regarding the team’s success to be revealed as true or not. The main thing I wanted to look at overall, was the offensive tragedy of the team over the last couple of seasons. To see where the Broncos have stood in comparison to other teams, we can see the story though information of the 40 worst-scoring NFL teams over the last decade. \n\n\n\n\nCode\n#2 beeswarm chart\nAFC <- c(\"Denver Broncos\", \"Kansas City Chiefs\", \"Las Vegas Raiders\",\"Cincinatti Bengals\",\"Buffalo Bills\", \"New England Patriots\",\"New York Jets\",\"Jacksonville Jaguars\",\"Pittsburgh Steelers\",\"Cleveland Browns\",\"Miami Dolphins\", \"Baltimore Ravens\", \"Indianapolis Colts\",\"Houston Texans\",\"Tennessee Titans\")\n\nAFCTeams <- scoring %>% filter(Tm %in% AFC)\n\nbroncos22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Denver Broncos\")\nchiefs22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nraiders22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Las Vegas Raiders\")\nbengals22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Cincinatti Bengals\")\nbillss22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Buffalo Bills\")\npatriotss22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"New England Patriots\")\njets22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"New York Jets\")\njaguars22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Jacksonville Jaguars\")\nsteelers22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Pittsburgh Steelers\")\nbrowns22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Cleveland Browns\")\ndolphins22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Miami Dolphins\")\nravens22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Baltimore Ravens\")\ncolts22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Indianapolis Colts\")\ntexans22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Houston Texans\")\ntitans22 <- scoring22 %>% filter(Tm== \"Tennessee Titans\")\n\n#beeswarm of den v kc \nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=AFCTeams, aes(x=`Sc%`, y=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=broncos22, aes(x=`Sc%`, y=Tm), color=\"#FB4F14\")+\n  geom_beeswarm(data=chiefs22, aes(x=`Sc%`, y=Tm), color=\"#E31837\")+\n   geom_encircle(data=broncos22, aes(x=`Sc%`, y=Tm), s_shape=0, expand=0, colour=\"black\")+ \n   geom_encircle(data=chiefs22, aes(x=`Sc%`, y=Tm), s_shape=0, expand=0, colour=\"black\")+\n  labs(\n    title=\"How does Denver compare to the rest of the league?\", \n    subtitle=\"Denver Broncos fans thought things would get better with time...\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Emma Luci\",\n    x=\"Percent of drives that ended in a score\", \n    y=\"\") + \ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nI wondered how the Broncos would align when compared to the rest of the league when being ranked by conference, so I looked at the scoring percentages of all of the AFC teams in the NFL. There has been a lot of tweets and news all over about Denver after their terrifying season opener game, and it made me want to know if my team was really falling to pieces as they seemed.\n\n\nCode\n#bumpchart of kc and den\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=scoring, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm)) + \n  geom_point(data=scoring, aes(x=Season, y=Rk, color=Tm), size = 4) +\n   labs(\n    title=\"How do the Broncos compare to the Chiefs?\", \n    subtitle=\"The loss of Peyton Manning caused a hit to the QB situation in Denver\",\n    caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Emma Luci\",\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Ranking\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#D3D3D3\",\"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\",\"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#FB4F14\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#E31837\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\", \"#D3D3D3\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2012,2014,2016,2018,2020,2022)) + \n  scale_y_reverse(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32))\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, Broncos fans have a deep burning hatred for the Kansas City Chiefs that runs through our bloodstream. With that being said, it is utterly painful to see the visuals of the absolute downfall of my favorite football team. It doesn’t take a wild guess to see that this huge drop-off had something to do with the painful loss of Peyton Manning after we won the 2015 Superbowl.\nAfter investigating multiple curiosities on the awful past performances of my favorite, I was slightly surprised to find out I was wrong when I had originally thought that this past season had to be the “historically worst” season for the franchise. It was surprising to look at how the Broncos lined up with the rest of the teams in the league. The hire of Sean Payton for $18 million per season as the newest head coach for the upcoming 2023 season is a new found spark of the dying flame that is my hope for the future of the Denver Broncos. I am interested to see what the return of Vance Joseph will bring to the team, as well as Joe Lombardi in charge of the offense. Well we all know the saying, so lets ride."
